<p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Neil Davis, and I&#39;m a rising senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I was raised in Newtown, Connecticut and Alberta, Canada, and currently live in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Ever since I was little, I have been fascinated by the limitless possibilities of the computer. I was and still am motivated to learn as much about computer science as possible and to make an impact for the greater good using technology.<br />
<br />
My time at UNC-Chapel Hill has given me greater exposure to computer science and how to use it to better the world. Through my time as a research assistant, I created computer games for visually impaired children for our Computer Science Department&#39;s annual Maze Day. I serve as a Lead Developer for the Carolina Tech Explorers. In addition to my involvement with computer science, I became increasingly interested in international development and human rights through my time with UNC&#39;s Model United Nations organization, CIRA, as well as through my International Relations and World History courses.<br />
<br />
Through those activities and classes, I became more aware of the hardships and struggles developing countries and their citizens have experienced to this day. I became inspired to use my degree in Computer Science to enter international development. I want to explore how technology can improve our world, beginning with&nbsp;the advancement of&nbsp;Internet infrastructures in developing countries to improve the standard of living of all people.&nbsp;I believe that strong&nbsp;Internet infrastructures will empower developing countries and their citizens, and I am determined to accomplish that goal.</p>
