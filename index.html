					<p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Neil Davis, and I&#39;m a software engineer at Microsoft in the Commerical Sales and Marketing division. I received my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and received a M.S. in Computer Science through UNC's accelerated Master's program. Ever since I was little, I have been fascinated by the limitless possibilities of the computer. I was and still am motivated to learn as much about computer science as possible and to make an impact for the greater good using technology.<br />
					<br />
					My time at UNC-Chapel Hill has given me greater exposure to computer science and how to use it to better the world. Through my time as a research assistant, I created computer games for visually impaired children for our Computer Science Department&#39;s annual Maze Day and created simulations to test airborne networks. I founded the organization CS+Social Good-UNC through the TechShift Alliance to foster an environment to be more thoughtful about how technology can and should be used for the greater good. In addition to my involvement with computer science, I became increasingly interested in international development and human rights through my time with UNC&#39;s Model United Nations organization, CIRA, as well as through my International Relations and World History lectures. I also became more involved in uplifting members in the Chapel Hill community who faced financial difficulties as an Advocate at the Community Empowerment Fund.<br />
					<br />
					Through those activities and classes, I became more aware of the hardships and struggles developing countries and their citizens have experienced to this day. I became inspired to use my degree in Computer Science to enter international development. I want to explore how technology can improve our world, beginning with&nbsp;the advancement of&nbsp;Internet infrastructures in developing countries to improve the standard of living of all people.&nbsp;I believe that strong&nbsp;Internet infrastructures will empower developing countries and their citizens, and I am determined to accomplish that goal.</p>
